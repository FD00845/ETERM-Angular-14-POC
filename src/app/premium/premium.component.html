                                                    <p>Term Insurance Plan is a form of life insurance which provides coverage for a defined period of time. If the insured individual dies during the policy term, the death benefit is payable to the nominees of the term policy. Term Insurance Plans are designed to protect your family financially in case of death or other uncertainties. The Online Term Plan is a highly flexible policy which provides financial support for you and your family in case of Accidental Total Permanent Disability (ATPD), Critical Illness (CI), and Death and Accidental Death (ADB).</p>

Multiplying the annual income by 10 is appropriate considering inflation and loss of income. If you are 30 years old and your annual income is INR 7 lakhs, your chosen Sum Assured should be INR 70 lakhs. The Sum Assured should also depend on other factors such as if you marry early or late, or when you have children. You should prepare a list of all your assets and liabilities, future goals etc., and finalize on an amount that you believe would work for you. </p>

                                                        <p>In a term insurance plan, a premium paying term is the period for which the buyer is committed to pay towards his/her insurance cover. In our Online Term Plan, we also have a grace period which is the time given for paying the premium from the premium due date during which the policy is supposed to be in force with the risk cover.</p>

Adding your annual income to your term plan would serve as an effective safeguard against inflation.

If you have a steady flow of income which allows you to pay your premiums on time, you are ready to invest in your future. Moreover, if you&apos;re already married, have children, or have parents who are dependent on you, you should definitely consider buying a term insurance plan. As you get older, the premium payable also increases. </p>
